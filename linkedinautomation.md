# LinkedIn Post Automation
- images from flywheel generation workflow should be saved in content folder within a folder to designate what topic/post the images belong to (so you can access them later)
- when pull requests are merged and changes are detected in content/linkedin a workflow publishes the mardown post along with an image (from the pull request generated by the flywheel workflow) to linked in using linkedin developer app
