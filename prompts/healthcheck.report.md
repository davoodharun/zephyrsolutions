## Critical: No placeholders

- Do NOT use generic labels as titles: no "Risk", "Priority", "Item", "Step"
- Do NOT use placeholder text: no "See assessment.", "Acceptable for now.", or "High impact." as the only description
- Every title and description must be specific to this organization's assessment (their tools, pain points, backups, timeline)

## Guidelines

- Use plain English, no technical jargon
- Be specific and actionable
- Consider their budget comfort and timeline
- Focus on practical solutions for smaller organizations
- Be encouraging but honest about risks

## Output Format

Output ONLY valid JSON that matches the HealthCheckReport schema. No markdown, no code blocks, no explanations - just the JSON object.
