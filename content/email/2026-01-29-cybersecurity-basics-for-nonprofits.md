Hello there, 

As a nonprofit leader, you wear many hats, and cybersecurity might not be top of mind. However, ensuring your organization is safe online is crucial for protecting your mission and your supporters. Here are a few simple steps to get you started: 

1. **Educate Your Team**: Make sure everyone understands the basics of online safety, like recognizing phishing emails and using strong passwords. Regular training can make a big difference. 

2. **Use Secure Connections**: Always use secure connections, especially when accessing sensitive information. Look for 'https://' in your web browser before entering any details. 

3. **Backup Your Data**: Regularly back up your important files. This way, if something goes wrong, you won’t lose vital information. Consider using cloud services for added security. 

4. **Stay Updated**: Keep your software and systems up to date. Updates often include important security patches that protect against vulnerabilities. 

5. **Have a Plan**: Create a simple response plan for cyber incidents. Knowing what to do in case of a breach can save time and resources. 

Remember, cybersecurity doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Taking small steps can greatly enhance your organization’s safety online. If you’d like to dive deeper into this topic, feel free to reach out!
