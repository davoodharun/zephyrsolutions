Hi there,

As a nonprofit communications lead, you know how important it is to protect your organization’s information. Cybersecurity might sound complex, but it doesn’t have to be! Here are a few straightforward steps you can take to help keep your nonprofit safe online:

1. **Use Strong Passwords**: Encourage your team to create unique passwords that mix letters, numbers, and symbols. Consider using a password manager to keep everything organized.

2. **Educate Your Team**: Regular training sessions on recognizing phishing emails and safe internet practices can go a long way. The more everyone knows, the safer your organization will be.

3. **Keep Software Updated**: Regular updates to your software and systems help patch security vulnerabilities. Set reminders to check for updates regularly.

4. **Backup Your Data**: Regularly back up your important files, either to an external hard drive or a secure cloud service. This ensures you can recover information if something goes wrong.

Remember, these simple actions can make a big difference. If you’d like more tips or resources, feel free to reach out!

Stay safe,
[Your Name]  
[Your Organization]
