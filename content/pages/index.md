    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">We specialize in web-based solutions and automation. Starting as a full-stack engineer, we've expanded to handle everything from cloud infrastructure to SaaS migrations. Here's what we can help you with:</p>
    
    <div class="service-item">
      <div class="two-column-content">
        <div class="column-left">
          <h3>Web Development & Applications</h3>
          <p>Full-stack web development is where we started, and it's still at the core of what we do. We build modern web applications, websites, and web-based tools that work well and are easy to maintain.</p>
          <p>Whether you need a new website, a web application for your team, or updates to an existing site, we handle both the front-end (what users see) and back-end (the systems that power it). We work with modern frameworks and tools to build solutions that are fast, secure, and scalable.</p>
          <p>From simple brochure sites to complex web applications, we create web-based solutions that fit your needs and your budget.</p>

      <div class="two-column-content two-column-content--reverse">
        <div class="column-left">
          <h3>Cloud Infrastructure & Automation</h3>
          <p>We set up and manage cloud infrastructure, automate deployments, and create infrastructure-as-code solutions that make your systems more reliable and easier to manage.</p>
          <p>Moving to the cloud or automating your infrastructure doesn't have to be overwhelming. We help you set up cloud services, configure automated deployments, and create scripts and templates that make managing your infrastructure straightforward. This means less manual work, fewer errors, and systems that are easier to update and maintain.</p>
          <p>Whether you're moving to Azure, setting up CI/CD pipelines, or automating routine tasks, we make cloud infrastructure work for you instead of the other way around.</p>

        <div class="column-left">
          <h3>SaaS Setup & On-Prem Migrations</h3>
          <p>We help you set up web-based SaaS services and migrate from on-premises systems to cloud-based solutions.</p>
          <p>If you're using software that runs on servers in your office (on-premises), moving to web-based services can save time, reduce maintenance, and give you more flexibility. We help you evaluate options, plan the migration, and handle the technical work of moving your data and processes to new systems.</p>
          <p>We also help you set up and configure SaaS tools—from project management platforms to customer relationship systems—so they work the way you need them to. The goal is to get you using modern, web-based tools without the headache of managing servers or dealing with outdated software.</p>

          <h3>Automation & Scripting</h3>
          <p>We automate repetitive tasks and create scripts that save you time and reduce errors.</p>
          <p>If you find yourself doing the same tasks over and over—moving data between systems, generating reports, updating files, or running routine maintenance—we can automate those processes. We write scripts and set up workflows that handle these tasks automatically, so you can focus on the work that actually needs your attention.</p>
          <p>Whether it's automating form submissions, syncing data between platforms, or creating custom scripts for your specific needs, we help you work smarter, not harder. The result is less manual work, fewer mistakes, and more time for the things that matter.</p>
