In today's digital age, cybersecurity is crucial for nonprofits. Understanding the basics can help protect your organization from potential threats. Start with these fundamental principles:

2. **Educate Your Team**: Regular training sessions can empower your staff to recognize phishing attempts and handle data securely. A well-informed team is your first line of defense.

3. **Use Strong Passwords**: Encourage the use of strong, unique passwords for all accounts. Consider password managers to help keep everything secure.
