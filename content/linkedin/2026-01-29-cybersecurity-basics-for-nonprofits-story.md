Last year, a small nonprofit in our community faced a serious cybersecurity threat. One of their employees fell for a phishing email that compromised their donor database. Thankfully, they acted quickly and managed to limit the damage. 

This incident was a wake-up call for them. They realized how crucial it was to educate their staff about cybersecurity basics. They organized training sessions and implemented simple policies, like using two-factor authentication and regularly updating passwords. 

Now, they feel more secure and can focus on their mission without constant worry about cyber threats. This story shows that even small steps can make a big difference in protecting your organization.
