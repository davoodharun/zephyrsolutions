In today's digital landscape, understanding cybersecurity is essential for nonprofits. It's not just about protecting data; it's about safeguarding your mission and the trust of your community. Start by recognizing the importance of strong passwords. Encourage your team to use unique, complex passwords for every account. 

Next, be aware of phishing attacks. These are deceptive emails or messages that appear legitimate but are designed to steal sensitive information. Training your team to spot these scams can prevent costly breaches. 

Regularly updating software and systems is another crucial step. Software updates often include security patches that protect against new threats. 

Lastly, consider having a cybersecurity policy in place. This can guide your organization in managing sensitive information and responding to potential incidents.
