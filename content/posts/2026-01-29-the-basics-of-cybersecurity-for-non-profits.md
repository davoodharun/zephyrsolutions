# The Basics of Cybersecurity for Non-Profits

Starting your cybersecurity journey doesn’t have to be overwhelming. By understanding some fundamental principles, your nonprofit can better protect itself against potential threats.

## Why Cybersecurity Matters for Small Organizations

In today’s digital world, small organizations and nonprofits are often targeted by cybercriminals. You may think that hackers are only interested in big companies, but that’s not the case. Nonprofits hold valuable data, including donor information and sensitive communications. A security breach could not only harm your organization’s reputation but also jeopardize the trust you’ve built with your supporters.

## Practical Steps to Enhance Your Cybersecurity

1. **Educate Your Team**  
   Everyone in your organization plays a role in cybersecurity. Start by holding a training session on the basics of online safety. Cover topics like recognizing phishing emails, creating strong passwords, and the importance of regular software updates.

2. **Use Strong Passwords**  
   Encourage your team to use complex passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Consider using a password manager to help keep track of them securely.

3. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**  
   2FA adds an extra layer of protection by requiring a second form of verification, like a text message code, in addition to a password. This makes it much harder for unauthorized users to access your accounts.

4. **Keep Software Updated**  
   Regularly update your software and applications. Updates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities.

5. **Back Up Your Data**  
   Regularly back up your important files. This ensures that if you do experience a cyber incident, you can recover your data without significant loss. Consider using cloud storage for automatic backups.

6. **Limit Access to Sensitive Information**  
   Only give access to sensitive data to those who need it for their work. This minimizes the risk of accidental or malicious breaches.

7. **Use Secure Networks**  
   Always connect to secure, password-protected networks, especially when handling sensitive information. Avoid using public Wi-Fi for important tasks.

## What Not to Do Yet

While it’s tempting to dive into advanced cybersecurity measures, take your time and avoid the following:

- **Don't Assume You’re Too Small to Be Targeted**  
   Many small organizations think they are not at risk, which can lead to complacency. Stay informed and aware of the threats out there.

- **Don’t Overcomplicate Your Approach**  
   Focus on the basics first. As your organization grows, you can explore more advanced security measures. Start simple, and build your strategy over time.

- **Avoid Ignoring Employee Training**  
   Training is not a one-time event. Make cybersecurity awareness a regular part of your organizational culture.

## Conclusion

Cybersecurity might seem daunting, but starting with these basic principles can significantly enhance your organization’s safety. As you implement these practices, you’ll build a culture of security that protects your mission and your supporters. 

If you’re ready to take the next step in your cybersecurity journey, consider reaching out for tailored advice or support. Together, we can ensure your nonprofit remains a safe and trusted space for everyone involved.
