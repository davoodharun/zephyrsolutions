# Full Stack edit for IT Health Check Form


I want to edit the Health check form:

- "IT Health Check" should be explained better to the user visting the site or a different name should be used. Explain that its a free assesment to asses what types of things your organization might need within the context of IT and Web Development
- more options to include in Current Tools: Excel, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Forms, Google Sheets, Sharepoint
- more pain points: large maintenance overhead, too much time doing repetitive tasks, website maintenance
- Caterr to a more non-technical audience; the audience for this form is very non-technical. Brief explanations should be included for some of the questions and "Not Sure" options should be included




- If the Notion db needs to be updated to match the form, include a csv file that I can import to notion
- add elements on the home page to highlight the form and guide users to it
